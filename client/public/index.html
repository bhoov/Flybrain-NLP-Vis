		<p>
			In this work (arXiv link), accepted to ICLR 2021, we study a well-established neurobiological network motif
			from the fruit fly brain and investigate the possibility of reusing its architecture for solving common
			natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Specifically, we focus on the network of Kenyon cells (KCs) (wiki
			link) in the mushroom body (wiki link) of the fruit fly brain. This network was trained on a large corpus of
			text and tested on common NLP tasks. Although biologically this network has evolved to process sensory
			stimuli from olfaction, visual system, and other modalities and not to ``understand'' language it uses a
			general purpose algorithm to embed inputs (from different modalities) into a high dimensional space, so that
			these embeddings are locality sensitive (Dasgupta, Ryali). This means that inputs that are similar to each
			other are mapped to similar representations, and inputs that are different are mapped to distant
			representations. Thus, our work illustrates a possibility to reprogram a biological general-purpose network
			to solve a useful machine learning task that the biological organism does not necessarily naturally engage
			in.

			In this blogpost we explore the concepts learned by the individual neurons of this network. We also study
			patterns of neuronâ€™s excitations in response to a query sentence. The pretrained models are available at
			(link).

			The mushroom body is a major area of the brain responsible for processing of sensory information in fruit
			flies. It receives inputs from a set of projection neurons (PN) conveying information from several sensory
			modalities. The major modality is olfaction (link to <d-cite key="bates2020complete"></d-cite>), but there
			are also inputs from the PNs responsible for sensing temperature and humidity <d-cite
				key="marin2020connectomics"></d-cite>, as well as visual inputs <d-cite key="vogt2016direct"></d-cite>
			<d-cite key="caron2020two"></d-cite>. These sensory inputs are forwarded to a population of Kenyon cells
			through a set of synaptic weights. KCs are reciprocally connected through an anterior paired lateral (APL)
			neuron, which sends a strong inhibitory signal back to KCs. This recurrent network effectively implements
			winner-takes-all competition between the KCs, and silences all but a small fraction of top activated
			neurons. The schematic of this architectural motif is shown in Figure <em>ARCHITECTURE</em>. In fruit flies
			KCs also send their outputs to mushroom body output neurons, but this part of the network is not included in
			our mathematical model.
