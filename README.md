# Flybrain-Vis

Visualize the Associative memory trained in a biologically plausible way on word embeddings

## Getting started

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml; \
conda env create -f environment-dev.yml; \ # optional
conda activate flybrain; \
pip install -e .
```

### Getting data

To get the model operational, you will need:
1. Synapse weights
2. Tokenizer file
3. Stop words used in the tokenization

To get the corpus searching features to work:
1. Training set, in the form of encodings and offsets to each of those sentences
2. Annotated corpus, containing the activations for every token in the subset of the training set

Note that these are all interdependent files. The tokenizer defines the vocabulary of the weights, the stop words indicate which words the weights did not learn, the training encodings were tokenized by the tokenizer, the weights were learned on the training encodings, and the annotated corpus was generated by the weights.
